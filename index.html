            <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
            <p class="y">The idea for the site came about because people were often asking for advice about which watch they should buy. The more this happened — and it happened a lot — the more we realized that searching for a watch online is a
              minefield of information.The individual brand websites are great, but there are hundreds of watch brands in Switzerland alone, so checking out each page individually would take you weeks, and that’s if you know the names of all the brands.</p>

            <h1>THE WATCH OF LUXURY</h1>
            <p class="y">A watch is a portable timepiece intended to be carried or worn by a person. It is designed to keep a consistent movement despite the motions caused by the person's activities. A wristwatch is designed to be worn around the wrist,attachedby a watch strap or other type of bracelet, including metal bands, leather straps, or any other kind of bracelet. A pocket watch is designed for a person to carry in a pocket, often attached to a chain.Watches were developed in the 17thcentury from spring-powered clocks, which appeared as early as the 14th century. During most of its history the watch was a mechanical device, driven by clockwork, powered by winding a mainspring, and keeping time with an oscillating balance wheel. </p>
