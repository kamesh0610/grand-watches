            <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
            <p class="y">The idea for the site came about because people were often asking for advice about which watch they should buy. The more this happened — and it happened a lot — the more we realized that searching for a watch online is a
              minefield of information.The individual brand websites are great, but there are hundreds of watch brands in Switzerland alone, so checking out each page individually would take you weeks, and that’s if you know the names of all the brands.</p>

            <h1>THE WATCH OF LUXURY</h1>
            <p class="y">A watch is a portable timepiece intended to be carried or worn by a person. It is designed to keep a consistent movement despite the motions caused by the person's activities. A wristwatch is designed to be worn around the wrist,attachedby a watch strap or other type of bracelet, including metal bands, leather straps, or any other kind of bracelet. A pocket watch is designed for a person to carry in a pocket, often attached to a chain.Watches were developed in the 17thcentury from spring-powered clocks, which appeared as early as the 14th century. During most of its history the watch was a mechanical device, driven by clockwork, powered by winding a mainspring, and keeping time with an oscillating balance wheel. </p>

            <h5>CITIZEN</h5>
            <p class="k">The brand Citizen was first registered in Switzerland by Schmid in 1918 for watches he sold in Japan.[3] The development of this brand was supported in the 1920s by Count Gotō Shinpei with his hope that watches could become
              affordable to
              the general public. The growth of Citizen relied on technology transfer from Switzerland.</p>

            <h5>FOSSIL</h5>
            <p class="k">Fossil was founded in 1984 as Overseas Products International by Tom Kartsotis, a former Texas A&M University student living in Dallas from a suggestion by his older brother, Kosta Kartsotis, a merchandising executive at
              Sanger-Harris.
              In 1990, they introduced leather goods under the Fossil brand, and the Relic line of watches.</p>

            <h5>ROLEX</h5>
            <p class="k">In 1908, Wilsdorf registered the trademark "Rolex", which became the brand name of watches from Wilsdorf and Davis. He opened an office in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland. Wilsdorf wanted the brand name to be easily
              pronounceable in any
              language, and short enough to fit on the face of a watch.</p>
